So this patient has been symptomatic for [DATE] now, started with a runny nose [DATE], then the cough came on maybe a day and a half ago. Parents were given Tylenol [DATE] for [DATE]. The fever broke about five hours ago. We're planning to observe for [DATE] before making a decision if she's still looking good tomorrow. Well, probably send her home.
