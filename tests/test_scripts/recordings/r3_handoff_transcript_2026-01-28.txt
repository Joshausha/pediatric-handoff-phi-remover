This is a seven-year-old named [NAME] with acute asthma exacerbation. He came in last night with a wheezing and increased work of breathing. We gave three rounds of albuterol in the ER and started him on oral steroids. He's improved significantly. His peak flow went from 50% to 80% of predicted. Currently he's on remair breathing comfortably. Plan is to observe for [DATE] and discharge with a rescue hailer and steroid taper.
