This 8 month old has [LOCATION]flow for [DATE] and initially came in [LOCATION]support. We started at 2L per [LOCATION]flow over [DATE]. She's been weaning nicely, currently on low flow and tolerating it well. If she stays stable on low flow for [DATE], we'll try [NAME]. Parents are comfortable with the plan.
