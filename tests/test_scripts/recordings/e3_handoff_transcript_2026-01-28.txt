This infant [NAME] [LOCATION]flow shortly after arrival, [LOCATION]flow at two liters per kilogram. Stats look good. We tried winning to low flow overnight, but she didn't tolerate it. She de-set it pretty quickly on low flow. So the plan is to [LOCATION]flow for now, maybe try coming [LOCATION]flow later today. If she fails that we'll keep [LOCATION]flow until she shows us she's ready.
