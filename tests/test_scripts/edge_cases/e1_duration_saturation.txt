So this patient has been symptomatic for about three days now. Started with
a runny nose two days ago, then the cough came on maybe a day and a half
ago. Parents were giving Tylenol every six hours for the past day or so.
Fever broke about five hours ago. We're planning to observe for another
twelve hours before making a decision. If she's still looking good tomorrow
morning, we'll probably send her home.
