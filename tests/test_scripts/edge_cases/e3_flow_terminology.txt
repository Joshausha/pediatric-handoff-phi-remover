This infant was placed on high flow shortly after arrival. Currently on
high at 2 liters per kilogram, sats look good. We tried weaning to low
flow overnight but she didn't tolerate it — desaturated pretty quickly
on low. So plan is to stay on high flow for now, maybe try coming down
on high later today. If she fails that, we'll keep her on high until
she shows us she's ready.
