This is day 4 of illness for this kid. He was diagnosed with pneumonia
three days ago at urgent care. They started azithromycin — he's had four
doses over the past two days. Cough has been improving slowly over the
last 24 hours. Still has some decreased breath sounds on the right side.
Plan is to continue outpatient management and recheck in two to three days.
