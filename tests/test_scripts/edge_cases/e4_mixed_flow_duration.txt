This 8 month old has been on high flow for the past two days. Initially
came in requiring pretty high support — we started at 2 liters per kg on
high. Over the last day and a half she's been weaning nicely. Currently
on low flow and tolerating it well. If she stays stable on low for another
six hours, we'll try room air. Parents are comfortable with the plan.
