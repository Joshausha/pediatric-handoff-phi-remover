This is Sarah, a 14 month old with RSV bronchiolitis. She came in yesterday
with increased work of breathing and nasal congestion. Currently on 2 liters
nasal cannula, sats stable in the mid-90s. She's tolerating feeds okay but
tires easily. Mom Jessica is at bedside, dad can be reached at the number
in the chart. Plan is to wean oxygen as tolerated and discharge when stable
on room air. No active concerns overnight.
