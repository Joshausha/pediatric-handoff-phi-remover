Picking up James, a 5 year old with community-acquired pneumonia. Admitted
three days ago with fever and cough, started on IV ceftriaxone. He's been
afebrile for two days now and eating well. Plan today is to transition to
oral amoxicillin if he continues to tolerate PO. His mom is working but
available by phone. Follow up with pediatrician in one week after discharge.
