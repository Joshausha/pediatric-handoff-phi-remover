Emily is a 2 year old with croup. She had the barky cough at home for about
a day, then developed stridor at rest this morning. Got racemic epi in the
ER with good response, also received dexamethasone. She's been in observation
for three hours now with no recurrent stridor. Plan is to watch for another
hour and discharge if she stays stable. Mom verbalized understanding of
return precautions.
