This is a 7 year old named Michael with acute asthma exacerbation. Came
in last night with wheezing and increased work of breathing. We gave
three rounds of albuterol in the ER and started him on oral steroids.
He's improved significantly — peak flow went from 50% to 80% of predicted.
Currently on room air, breathing comfortably. Plan is observe for another
few hours and discharge with rescue inhaler and steroid taper.
