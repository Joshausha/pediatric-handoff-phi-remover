This is a 6 week old male, born full term, here for fever without source.
Temperature was 38.5 at home. We did the full sepsis workup — blood, urine,
and LP all sent. Started empiric ampicillin and ceftriaxone while awaiting
cultures. CSF looked clear. Parents are understandably anxious. Plan is to
continue antibiotics for 48 hours pending cultures. Dad is staying overnight.
