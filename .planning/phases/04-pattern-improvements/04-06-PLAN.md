<objective>
Analyze remaining gaps after easy wins (04-04, 04-05) and make decisions on risky pattern additions.

Purpose: After addressing phone numbers and hyphenated rooms, significant gaps remain:
- ROOM standalone numbers (e.g., "847", "16", "512") - high false positive risk with ages/vitals
- MRN unprefixed numbers (e.g., "2694522", "46855845") - could conflict with phone numbers
- LOCATION full addresses - fundamental NER limitation

This plan analyzes the tradeoffs and captures decisions on whether to implement risky patterns.

Output: GAP_ANALYSIS.md documenting decisions and expected remaining gaps.

  <name>Task 1: Re-run validation to measure improvement from 04-04 and 04-05</name>
  <files>tests/results/post_gap_closure.json</files>
  <action>
Run the validation script to measure the impact of phone number and hyphenated room fixes:

```bash
python scripts/run_validation.py --output tests/results/post_gap_closure.json
```

If that script doesn't exist, use the evaluation script:
```bash
python scripts/evaluate_phi.py tests/synthetic_handoffs.json --output tests/results/post_gap_closure.json
```

Extract key metrics:
- Overall recall (was 83.0%)
- PHONE_NUMBER recall (was 73.9%)
- ROOM recall (was 43.3%)
- Remaining false negatives by type

Calculate expected improvement:
- Phone fixes: ~40 FNs addressed out of 257 = ~15% of total FNs
- Hyphenated room fixes: ~11 FNs addressed = ~4% of total FNs
- Expected new recall: ~83% + ~5% = ~88%

  <context>
**Current state after 04-04/04-05:** Recall improved but still below 95% target.

**Remaining gaps:**
1. **ROOM standalone numbers** (~50 FNs): Numbers like "847", "16", "512" without "Room" prefix
2. **MRN unprefixed numbers** (~40 FNs): 7-8 digit numbers without "#" or "MRN" prefix
3. **LOCATION addresses** (~80 FNs): Full addresses, hospital names, city names

**Analysis:**

**Option A: Add ROOM standalone number pattern**
- Pattern: `\b\d{1,3}\b` with room context words
- Pro: Would catch most standalone room numbers
- Con: Would false-positive on:
  - Ages: "4 year old" - 4 detected as room
  - Vitals: "HR 120" - 120 detected as room
  - Doses: "give 5 mg" - 5 detected as room
  - Temperatures: "temp 38.5" - 38 detected as room
  - Saturations: "sats 98" - 98 detected as room
- Risk: HIGH - would over-redact clinically useful content
- Impact: +50 TPs, estimated +200 FPs

**Option B: Add MRN unprefixed pattern**
- Pattern: `\b\d{7,8}\b` (7-8 digit numbers)
- Pro: Would catch unprefixed MRNs
- Con: Would conflict with:
  - Phone numbers without formatting
  - ZIP codes in addresses
  - Other 7-8 digit numbers
- Risk: MEDIUM - some over-redaction but less impactful
- Impact: +40 TPs, estimated +30 FPs

**Option C: Accept limitations and document residual risk**
- Pro: Maintains high precision, clinically readable transcripts
- Con: Recall stays below 95% target
- Mitigation: User performs manual review of de-identified transcripts
- Risk: LOW - known limitations, documented for compliance

3. **Remaining gaps by category**:
   - ROOM standalone: ~50 FNs - [decision from checkpoint]
   - MRN unprefixed: ~40 FNs - [decision from checkpoint]
   - LOCATION addresses: ~80 FNs - Presidio NER limitation, not addressable
   - Other: ~10 FNs - rare edge cases
4. **Decision record**: [based on checkpoint response]
5. **Residual risk assessment**:
   - Expected final recall after decisions
