## Handoff 1: Post-Appendectomy (7yo) - Simple

So, uh, hey, I got Thomas for you—7-year-old, came in yesterday with appy. We took him to the OR, did an open appendectomy... let's see, that was about 18 hours ago now. Doing really well, pretty stable patient. Temperature's been good all night, vitals—yeah, vitals have been solid. Um, he's tolerating clears now, actually had a pretty decent appetite this morning which is great.

Mm-hmm.

Yeah, exactly. Pain's controlled on just ibuprofen, he's not asking for anything stronger. The main thing is, you know, just keep an eye on the incision. Watch for any signs of infection, redness, drainage, that kind of thing. And obviously temperature—though honestly it's been perfect so far, like I said.

Right, so incision checks, monitor temp. You advancing diet today?

Yeah, that's the plan. If he keeps tolerating the clears this morning, I'd say try regular diet this afternoon. Oh, and I should mention—his parents are really happy with how things are going. Kid's in good spirits, playing with his tablet and stuff.

Good, that's always nice. Discharge timeline?

I'm thinking tomorrow if everything stays stable. Barring any issues with the diet advancement or if he spikes a fever or something. But honestly, should be a pretty easy one for you today.

Perfect. I'll check on him in a bit, make sure the incision looks good.

Great, thanks. I think you'll be pleased—very straightforward case.

Sounds good.

## Handoff 2: Bronchiolitis (3yo) - Simple

Hey, I got Emma for you—3-year-old who came in, uh, two days ago with bronchiolitis. She's doing really well, like, much better than yesterday. She's on 2 liters of nasal cannula right now and her sats are running—let's see—94 to 97%, which is nice and stable. Um, she's back to being playful, eating and drinking normally, coughing much less than when she came in. Her vitals are all good, so...

Mm-hmm, okay.

Yeah, so what I want you to watch for today is whether we can wean her oxygen. I think she's probably ready to try dropping down to 1 liter and see how she does. You know, if her sats drop below 92, just keep her where she is, but I have a feeling she's going to do fine coming off the higher oxygen.

Okay, so you're thinking we try 1 liter. If sats hold above 92, we're good?

Yeah, exactly. If sats are good on 1 liter, you could even be looking at discharge later, um, if she stays stable on room air or minimal oxygen. But take it one step at a time, yeah?

Got it. Wean to 1 liter, watch sats. If she tolerates that well, we could be looking at discharge. I'll check on her first thing and try the wean.

She slept great last night, no fevers, and frankly she's acting like her normal self again. Parents are really happy with the progress, actually.

Perfect. I'll get her started on that wean right away.

Great, thanks. She's a really straightforward case now.

Sounds good.

## Handoff 3: Gastroenteritis (10yo) - Simple

Hi, I've got Marcus for you. He's a 10-year-old who came in yesterday afternoon with acute gastroenteritis—you know, vomiting and diarrhea. He was mildly dehydrated when he arrived, so we got him on IV fluids pretty quickly and gave him ondansetron for the nausea. Um, he's actually been doing really well since then. He hasn't vomited or had any diarrhea in about twelve hours, he's afebrile, vitals are stable, and honestly he's been asking for food, which is a good sign.

That's great. So he's tolerating PO now?

Yeah, we started him on clear liquids last night and he tolerated those fine. No problems at all. My plan is to continue the IV fluids through this morning and then transition him to a full oral diet as tolerated. If he keeps tolerating PO intake and his urine output stays adequate, he should be ready for discharge this afternoon. His parents are actually really involved and everything looks good with them.

Okay, so continue IV through the morning, then advance diet. Discharge this afternoon if he does well with food and has good urine output. Anything else I should watch for?

Just keep an eye on his intake and output, especially making sure he's making adequate urine. Some kids will still have occasional diarrhea even after they're feeling better, so don't be alarmed if he has one or two loose stools—that's actually pretty normal during recovery. But if he has another bout of vomiting or if the diarrhea gets worse, hold off on advancing his diet and let me or the attending know.

Got it. Monitor intake and output, occasional loose stools are fine, but hold off if he vomits again or diarrhea worsens. I'll check on him this morning and we'll work toward advancing his diet this afternoon.

Sounds good. Thanks.

## Handoff 4: Sickle Cell Crisis (12yo) - Moderate

Hi Dr. Nelson, I've got Jamal for you—12-year-old with known sickle cell disease, admitted yesterday with an acute pain crisis. He was having chest and abdominal pain, um, pretty significant. We got him started on a PCA pump with morphine and it's working really well, honestly. He's super comfortable now, like, actually joking around with the nurses, which is great to see. We've got him on supplemental oxygen—his sats are running nice and high, like 94 to 98 percent, so that's good. And we're running normal saline at 100 mL per hour for hydration.

Okay, pain controlled, O2 on board, IV fluids running.

Yeah, exactly. His labs from this morning—hemoglobin is 8.2, which is like his baseline for sickle cell patients, and his reticulocyte count is elevated, which is kind of expected with his disease, you know. He actually slept most of the night, which is good. And he's eating pretty well when his pain is controlled. His mom's at bedside, which helps—she's familiar with his pain patterns.

That's good. He seems stable then. What do you want me to focus on today?

Um, just continue the pain management, keep him on the oxygen and IV fluids. Let me know if his pain increases or if, you know, if anything changes. We'll probably discharge him in another day or so if he stays stable.

Okay, so continue PCA, keep the oxygen going, IV fluids running. I'll watch him and update you if pain increases or anything changes. I'll see him first thing this morning.

## Handoff 5: First-Time Seizure (8yo) - Moderate

Hi Dr. Kumar, I have Marcus for you. He's an 8-year-old who had a seizure yesterday—um, his first one, lasted about three minutes. He was post-ictal for a while but he's doing pretty well now, like, very alert, talking, playing, you know, back to his normal self. His head CT was normal, basic labs are all normal. We went ahead and started him on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis. Um, we're waiting on EEG results that should come back today and also, uh, some metabolic workup to figure out, you know, what actually caused this. He had the one seizure episode but, um, we haven't seen any more seizure activity since then.

Okay, first-time seizure. CT normal, labs normal, on Keppra. He's alert now and hasn't had another seizure since yesterday?

Right, hasn't seized again. Just, um, monitor him and let me know when the EEG comes back and when we get those metabolic results.

So like... is he currently stable then? Or are we still pretty concerned about recurrence?

Um, I mean, he's alert and doing well, so... yeah, just keep an eye on him. Let me know if anything changes.

## Handoff 6: DKA Infant (3mo) - Complex

Um, okay, so I have this 3-month-old—um, really little baby—who came in yesterday, and, you know, honestly I—I'm not super familiar with neonatal DKA, so—honestly I really don't know a lot about her. She's got DKA and we're treating it with, um, insulin and fluids. Her pH when she came in was really low, like, really low—6.8, which I know is bad. The glucose was... let me think... like 600 or something when she came in. Um, we've got her on an insulin drip and we're running normal saline. But I'm not sure exactly what her current glucose is actually. I think the nurse has been checking it but—[nurse calls in background] —wait, sorry, one second—[pause]—okay, um, where was I? Right, so she's got an IV line in, vitals are... I haven't checked them in a bit actually. Her mom's asking me a lot of questions about what's going to happen and, honestly, I'm not really sure how to explain DKA to her. Um, this kid probably needs ICU but we're sort of managing her here for now, I guess. Not totally sure what else to do.

Wait, hold on. Did you just check her glucose?

Um, I think the nurse has been checking it, but I don't have—I'm not sure of the current value right now. The glucose was down from 600 but, um... [trails off] I should probably check with the nurse about what the actual number is.

So you don't have her current glucose level? She's on an insulin drip and you don't know what her number is?

Yeah, I... I should probably look that up. Do you know how to manage DKA in a 3-month-old? I feel like this is beyond what I usually see.
