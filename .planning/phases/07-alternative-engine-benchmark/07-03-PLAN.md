<objective>
Run comparative benchmark of all three engines (Presidio, Philter-UCSF, Stanford BERT) on the full synthetic dataset and document the engine selection decision.

Purpose: Determine whether switching engines provides >5% weighted recall improvement over current Presidio setup to justify the migration effort.

Output: ENGINE_BENCHMARK.md with comparative results, decision, and residual risk documentation.

  <name>Task 1: Spot-check synthetic data annotation quality</name>
  <files>None (analysis only)</files>
  <action>
1. Load 20 random samples from synthetic_handoffs.json
2. For each sample, manually review:
   - Are all PHI spans correctly annotated?
   - Are there any missed PHI in the text?
   - Are entity types correctly labeled?
3. Document any annotation issues found
4. If issues found:
   - Fix annotations in source dataset
   - Ensure same fixes apply to all engine benchmarks (fair comparison)
5. Document confidence level in annotation quality

This prevents garbage-in-garbage-out benchmark results.

Print 5 sample texts with their annotations visually highlighted.
Document annotation quality assessment (pass/fix needed).

1. Run Presidio baseline (current system):
   ```bash
   python tests/evaluate_presidio.py --input tests/synthetic_handoffs.json --weighted -o results/presidio_standard.txt
   python tests/evaluate_presidio.py --input tests/adversarial_handoffs.json --weighted -o results/presidio_adversarial.txt
   ```

2. Run Philter-UCSF:
   ```bash
   python scripts/benchmark_philter.py --input tests/synthetic_handoffs.json --weighted -o results/philter_standard.txt
   python scripts/benchmark_philter.py --input tests/adversarial_handoffs.json --weighted -o results/philter_adversarial.txt
   ```

3. Run Stanford BERT:
   ```bash
   # Note: May take 1-2 hours on CPU
   python scripts/benchmark_bert.py --weighted -o results/bert_standard.txt
   python scripts/benchmark_bert.py --input tests/adversarial_handoffs.json --weighted -o results/bert_adversarial.txt
   ```

4. Collect metrics from each run:
   - Weighted recall (primary decision metric)
   - Weighted precision (must be >70%)
   - Weighted F2
   - Per-entity breakdown for high-weight types (GUARDIAN_NAME, ROOM, PERSON)

5. Calculate improvement thresholds:
   - Philter improvement = Philter_weighted_recall - Presidio_weighted_recall
   - BERT improvement = BERT_weighted_recall - Presidio_weighted_recall
   - Flag engines with >5% improvement as candidates

Create comprehensive benchmark documentation:

1. Executive Summary
   - Decision made and rationale
   - Key metrics comparison table
   - Residual risk for selected approach

2. Methodology
   - Dataset: 600 handoffs (500 standard + 100 adversarial)
   - Metrics: Weighted recall (primary), weighted precision, weighted F2
   - Weights: PERSON/GUARDIAN=5, ROOM=4, PHONE/DATE=2, MRN=1, others=0
   - Improvement threshold: >5% weighted recall

3. Results Table
   | Engine | Weighted Recall | Weighted Precision | Weighted F2 | vs Presidio |
   |--------|-----------------|--------------------| ------------|-------------|
   | Presidio | X.X% | X.X% | X.X% | baseline |
   | Philter | X.X% | X.X% | X.X% | +/-X.X% |
   | BERT | X.X% | X.X% | X.X% | +/-X.X% |

4. Per-Entity Breakdown (high-weight entities)
   - PERSON/GUARDIAN_NAME: Which engine performed best?
   - ROOM: Pattern coverage comparison
   - Any entity type where one engine significantly outperforms?

5. Decision Analysis
   - Did any engine meet the >5% improvement threshold?
   - Precision floor check (all >70%?)
   - Hybrid evaluation if no clear winner

6. Residual Risk
   - Document remaining gaps with selected approach
   - Mitigation strategies (user review, additional patterns)

7. Next Steps
   - If switching: Migration plan outline
   - If staying with Presidio: Resume 05-04 expert review
