<objective>
Install Philter-UCSF and translate current pediatric/medical patterns to Philter configuration format.

Purpose: Enable fair comparison of Philter's rule-based de-identification against current Presidio setup on spoken handoff data.

Output: Working Philter installation with pediatric pattern configuration and benchmarking script.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Install Philter-UCSF and test lookbehind support</name>
  <files>requirements.txt</files>
  <action>
1. Add philter-ucsf to requirements.txt
2. Install with pip: `pip install philter-ucsf`
3. Test lookbehind pattern support with simple pattern:
   - Create test pattern: `(?<=mom )\w+`
   - Run on sample text: "mom jessica brought baby smith"
   - Document result: either pattern matches "jessica" or fails
4. If lookbehind fails, test alternative approach:
   - Rewrite pattern as: `\b(?:mom)\s+(\w+)\b` (capture group)
   - Document which approach works for pattern translation

CRITICAL: This determines pattern translation strategy for Task 2. If lookbehind not supported, all patterns must be rewritten.

Lookbehind test result documented in script comments.

  <name>Task 2: Create Philter pattern configuration and benchmark script</name>
  <files>configs/philter_pediatric.json, patterns/guardian_patterns.txt, patterns/room_patterns.txt, scripts/benchmark_philter.py</files>
  <action>
1. Create pattern files for Philter (one regex per line):
   - `patterns/guardian_patterns.txt`: Translate patterns from pediatric.py (GuardianNameRecognizer)
     - mom/dad/mother/father + name patterns
     - Use format that works from Task 1 (lookbehind or capture group)
   - `patterns/room_patterns.txt`: Translate from medical.py (RoomRecognizer)
     - room/bed/bay patterns with unit names

2. Create `configs/philter_pediatric.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "patterns": [
       {
         "title": "guardian_names",
         "type": "regex",
         "filepath": "./patterns/guardian_patterns.txt",
         "exclude": true,
         "phi_type": "GUARDIAN_NAME"
       },
       {
         "title": "room_numbers",
         "type": "regex",
         "filepath": "./patterns/room_patterns.txt",
         "exclude": true,
         "phi_type": "ROOM"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. Create `scripts/benchmark_philter.py`:
   - Load synthetic_handoffs.json and adversarial_handoffs.json
   - Run Philter on each handoff text
   - Compare Philter PHI spans against ground truth (same logic as evaluate_presidio.py)
   - Calculate precision, recall, F2, weighted metrics
   - Output report in same format as Presidio evaluator
   - Include --weighted flag for spoken handoff weights

4. Use EvaluationMetrics class from evaluate_presidio.py for metric calculation (import, don't duplicate)

NOTE: Focus on high-weight patterns (GUARDIAN_NAME weight=5, ROOM weight=4). Skip MRN (weight=1) and PEDIATRIC_AGE (disabled).
  </action>
  <verify>
```bash
# Run Philter benchmark on small sample
python scripts/benchmark_philter.py --input tests/synthetic_handoffs.json --verbose | head -50
```
Script runs without errors and produces metrics output.
  </verify>
  <done>Philter pattern config complete, benchmark script produces precision/recall/F2 metrics matching format of Presidio evaluator.</done>
</task>

1. `pip show philter-ucsf` shows installed version
2. `python -c "from philter_ucsf import Philter"` succeeds
3. `python scripts/benchmark_philter.py --input tests/synthetic_handoffs.json` runs and outputs metrics
4. Pattern files exist: `configs/philter_pediatric.json`, `patterns/*.txt`
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Philter-UCSF installed and importable
- Pediatric patterns translated to Philter format with documented approach (lookbehind or alternative)
- Benchmark script runs on synthetic dataset and produces comparable metrics to Presidio evaluator
- Ready for comparative benchmark in 07-03
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/07-alternative-engine-benchmark/07-01-SUMMARY.md`
