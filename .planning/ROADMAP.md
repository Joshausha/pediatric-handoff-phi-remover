<summary>✅ v2.0 CI/CD Pipeline Fix (Phase 9) - SHIPPED 2026-01-26</summary>

### Phase 9: CI/CD Pipeline Fix
**Goal**: Green CI with numpy<2.0 constraint and aligned test expectations
**Plans**: 2 plans
- [x] 09-01: Fix dependency conflicts (numpy, philter-ucsf)
- [x] 09-02: Align test expectations with v1.0 behavior

### 🚧 v2.1 Over-Detection Quality Pass (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Reduce false positives by expanding deny lists based on systematic testing with realistic and edge-case handoff scripts.

#### Phase 10: Test Script Generation and Recording
**Goal**: Realistic and edge-case handoff test data created and processed
**Depends on**: Phase 9 (CI/CD working)
**Requirements**: TEST-01, TEST-02, TEST-03, TEST-04, TEST-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User has at least 6 realistic I-PASS handoff scripts covering respiratory support and medication dosing
  2. User has at least 4 edge-case scripts targeting duration phrases and flow terminology
  3. User has recorded audio versions of all test scripts
  4. User has processed recordings through PHI detection pipeline
  5. User has documented all false positives discovered during processing
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 10-01-PLAN.md — Prepare test scripts and documentation infrastructure
- [ ] 10-02-PLAN.md — Record, process, and document false positives

#### Phase 11: Deny List Expansion and Unit Preservation
**Goal**: False positives eliminated via targeted deny list additions and config fixes
**Depends on**: Phase 10 (test data processed)
**Requirements**: DENY-01, DENY-02, DENY-03, DENY-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Duration patterns ("one day", "two days", "three days", etc.) no longer flagged as DATE_TIME
  2. Medical flow terms ("high flow", "on high", "placed on high") no longer flagged as LOCATION
  3. LOCATION deny list uses substring matching with word boundaries (like DATE_TIME)
  4. Unit names (PICU, NICU) preserved during ROOM redaction
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 11-01: TBD during planning

#### Phase 12: Regression Validation and CI Verification
**Goal**: No regressions on real handoffs and green CI with expanded deny lists
**Depends on**: Phase 11 (deny lists expanded)
**Requirements**: VAL-01, VAL-02, VAL-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All 27 real handoff recordings still pass validation (no new false negatives)
  2. All false positives from test script processing are documented in research/ or tests/
  3. CI passes with expanded deny lists (all workflows green)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 12-01: TBD during planning
