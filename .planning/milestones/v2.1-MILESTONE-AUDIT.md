# v2.1 Over-Detection Quality Pass - Milestone Audit

**Milestone:** v2.1 Over-Detection Quality Pass
**Audited:** 2026-01-29T01:50:39Z
**Status:** PASSED
**Auditor:** Claude (gsd-integration-checker + orchestrator)

## Executive Summary

All 12 requirements satisfied. All 3 phases verified. Cross-phase integration complete. E2E flows verified. v2.1 is ready to ship.

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Phase | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| TEST-01 | 10 | ✓ SATISFIED | 6 realistic scripts in tests/test_scripts/realistic/ |
| TEST-02 | 10 | ✓ SATISFIED | Medication dosing terminology present (ampicillin, ceftriaxone) |
| TEST-03 | 10 | ✓ SATISFIED | Edge-case scripts e1, e2, e4 target duration phrases |
| TEST-04 | 10 | ✓ SATISFIED | Edge-case scripts e3, e4 target flow terminology |
| TEST-05 | 10 | ✓ SATISFIED | All 10 scripts recorded, processed, documented |
| DENY-01 | 11 | ✓ SATISFIED | 70+ duration patterns in deny_list_date_time |
| DENY-02 | 11 | ✓ SATISFIED | 16+ flow terms in deny_list_location |
| DENY-03 | 11 | ✓ SATISFIED | LOCATION uses substring matching with word boundaries |
| DENY-04 | 11 | ✓ SATISFIED | Lookbehind patterns preserve PICU, NICU, etc. |
| VAL-01 | 12 | ✓ SATISFIED | Recall unchanged at 86.4% (no regression) |
| VAL-02 | 12 | ✓ SATISFIED | 36 regression tests + VERIFICATION_RESULTS.md |
| VAL-03 | 12 | ✓ SATISFIED | CI passing (208 passed, 8 xfailed, 1 xpassed) |

**Score: 12/12 requirements (100%)**

## Phase Verification

| Phase | Goal | Verified | Status | Score |
|-------|------|----------|--------|-------|
| 10-test-script-generation | Realistic and edge-case handoff test data created and processed | 2026-01-28T20:42:14Z | PASSED | 5/5 |
| 11-deny-list-expansion | False positives eliminated via targeted deny list additions | 2026-01-28T19:59:13Z | PASSED | 4/4 |
| 12-regression-validation | No regressions and green CI | 2026-01-29T02:09:00Z | PASSED | 3/3 |

**Score: 3/3 phases verified (100%)**

## Cross-Phase Integration

| From | To | Connection | Status |
|------|----|-----------| --------|
| Phase 10 FALSE_POSITIVE_LOG.md | Phase 11 deny lists | 45 instances → 70+ DATE_TIME, 16+ LOCATION entries | ✓ WIRED |
| Phase 10 test scripts | Phase 11 regression tests | 10 scripts → 36 parametrized tests | ✓ WIRED |
| Phase 11 deny lists | app/deidentification.py | Lines 184-213 consume all lists | ✓ WIRED |
| Phase 11 changes | Phase 12 validation | Regression report confirms no regression | ✓ WIRED |

**Score: 4/4 integrations (100%)**

## E2E Flow Verification

### Audio Upload → Clean Transcript

| Step | Component | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 1. Upload | POST /api/process (main.py:324) | ✓ VERIFIED |
| 2. Validate | Size/format checks (main.py:366-370) | ✓ VERIFIED |
| 3. Transcribe | faster-whisper (transcription.py) | ✓ VERIFIED |
| 4. De-identify | Presidio + deny lists (deidentification.py) | ✓ VERIFIED |
| 5. Filter | Deny list checks (deidentification.py:184-213) | ✓ VERIFIED |
| 6. Respond | ProcessResponse with clean_transcript | ✓ VERIFIED |

**Score: 1/1 flows complete (100%)**

## Metrics Improvement

| Metric | Before v2.1 | After v2.1 | Change |
|--------|-------------|------------|--------|
| False Positives | 45 documented | 0 remaining | -100% |
| Precision | 66.3% | 69.0% | +2.7% |
| Recall | 86.4% | 86.4% | No change |
| Regression Tests | 0 | 36 | +36 new tests |

## Tech Debt (Non-Blocking)

These are known under-detection issues tracked via xfail markers, NOT blockers:

| Category | Issue | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| PHONE_NUMBER | 7-digit numbers without area code | xfail marker |
| PEDIATRIC_AGE | Complex formats like "3 weeks 2 days old" | xfail marker |
| LOCATION | Street addresses without context | xfail marker |
| PERSON | School names like "Jefferson Elementary" | xfail marker |

**Total: 4 items tracked as tech debt for future milestones**

These were documented before v2.1 and remain unchanged—they are NOT regressions from this milestone.

## CI/CD Status

| Workflow | Status | Details |
|----------|--------|---------|
| test.yml | ✓ GREEN | 208 passed, 8 xfailed, 1 xpassed |
| docker.yml | ✓ GREEN | Build completes ~24s |

## Milestone Definition of Done

From ROADMAP.md and PROJECT.md:

1. ✓ Generate realistic and edge-case I-PASS handoff test scripts
2. ✓ Record and process to discover over-detection issues
3. ✓ Fix deny lists for duration phrases, medical flow terminology, unit preservation
4. ✓ Validate no regressions

**All milestone objectives achieved.**

## Conclusion

**v2.1 Over-Detection Quality Pass PASSED audit.**

- 12/12 requirements satisfied
- 3/3 phases verified with formal VERIFICATION.md
- 4/4 cross-phase integrations wired
- 1/1 E2E flows complete
- 100% false positive elimination achieved
- Zero regressions on recall
- CI/CD all green

**Ready for /gsd:complete-milestone v2.1**
